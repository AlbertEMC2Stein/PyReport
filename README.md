## Roadmap
Our development roadmap is structured to follow a bottom-up approach, starting with fundamental features and gradually adding more advanced capabilities.

### Basic Functionality
- [x] Create LaTeX documents with text content.
- [x] Define sections and chapters for structuring your report.
- [ ] Add custom environments and commands.
- [ ] Add remaining symbols/math-operators 
- [x] Populate your report with plaintext.
- [x] Automate report generation with the `Reporter` class.

### Data Representation
- [ ] Add more environments for formatting text and data, e.g. center, figure, table, etc.
    - [ ] Add support for matplotlib figures and plots, e.g. with an Environment that can take a figure object, save it to a temporary file and then include it in the report.
    - [ ] Add support for custom data-viz via TikZ, e.g. Environment that can take various types of data and then creates an appropriate visualization given some settings.
    - [ ] Add support for .csv files to automatically create tables.
- [ ] Add environment that automatically displays source code via `inspect.getsource()` and listings.

### Mathematical Expressions
- [ ] Add support for mathematics with math environments like `align`, `equation`, etc.
- [ ] Add support for variables that can either be displayed as symbol or the value they hold.
- [ ] Support for variable tracking to see how variables change over time.
    - [ ] Add `x.watch` to automatically log the variable `x` whenever it changes. 
    - [ ] Make it possible to specify a list of variables to only log interactions with them, e.g. `x.watch([y, z])` only logs interactions of `x` with `y` and `z`.
- [ ] Builing formulas via python operations, e.g. `Variable(alpha, 0.5) + Variable(beta, 0.5)` either renders to $\alpha + \beta$ or returns the value 1.0.
- [ ] Add support for function evaluations and Variable assignments via `Function(f, lambda x: x**2)` and `Variable(x, 2)` such that `f(x)` renders to $f(x) = x^2$ and `f(x).value` returns 4.
- [ ] Add variable logging to see how the variable changes over time (maybe even own Logging environment?).
 
### Advanced Mathematical Concepts
- [ ] Support for vectors, matrices, and non-scalar functions.
- [ ] Handle custom function evaluations and variable assignments.
- [ ] Implement a variable glossary for variable documentation.

### Integration and References
- [ ] Add label-referencing support.
- [ ] Implement bibliography and sources, including automatic citation generation via classes like Article, Book, Report, etc.
- [ ] Automatically generate a glossary from provided variables with descriptions.

### High-level Convenience
- [ ] Provide a context manager with `with Reporter(...) as report` for streamlined report creation.
- [ ] Create custom style files to customize the report's appearance.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlbertEMC2Stein/pyreport.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install pyreport:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

4. Use the provided examples and documentation to start automating your reports with pyreport.

## Usage
To start generating reports, follow these basic steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

    ```python
    from pyreport.math import *
    from pyreport.report import *
    ```

2. Create a `Reporter` instance:

    ```python
    report = Reporter('Your_Report_Name')
    ```

3. Add content to your report using the available functions and classes.

4. Save or export your report to the desired format, such as LaTeX or PDF.

## Examples
Here's an example of how to create a simple report with pyreport:

```python
from pyreport.math import *
from pyreport.report import *

report = Reporter('My_Report')

# Define a mathematical function
f = Function(f, lambda x: x**2)

# Create a variable and log its changes
x = Variable(x, 0, watch=True)
for i in range(100):
    x = x + i

print(x)  # -> 5050 or x = 5050
print(f(x, eval=True))  # -> 25502500

# Add equations and variable trace to the report
report.add(Equation(f, x, symbols=True))  # f(x) = x^2
report.add(Equation(f, x, symbols=False))  # -> f(x) = 25502500 
report.add(x.create_trace())  # -> 1:   x = 0     2:   x = 1     3: x = 3 ...
```
