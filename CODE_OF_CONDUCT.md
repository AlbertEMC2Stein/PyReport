# Code of Conduct

We, the contributors and maintainers of the pyreport project, are committed to fostering an open and welcoming community. We value diversity and encourage participation from people of all backgrounds. We want everyone involved to have a positive and harassment-free experience.

As a contributor, you agree to abide by this code of conduct when participating in the project's community, whether through code, issues, documentation, or any other form of contribution.

## Our Standards

We ask all contributors to show respect and empathy to others, keeping in mind the shared goal of improving the project. Be mindful of your words and actions, and do not engage in any form of harassment, discrimination, or harmful behavior.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, age, disability, or religion.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing private information without permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it to the project maintainers at [prokosch@rhrk.uni-kl.de](mailto:prokosch@rhrk.uni-kl.de). All complaints will be kept confidential. In your report, please provide as much information as possible, including any relevant links or evidence.

The project team is committed to respecting the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

We will review and investigate all complaints promptly and fairly. In response to a complaint, we may take any action deemed appropriate, which may include warning the offender, temporary or permanent banning from the project, or any other actions to maintain a positive and respectful community.

We will do our best to ensure all parties involved are treated with fairness and respect.
